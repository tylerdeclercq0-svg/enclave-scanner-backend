"""
Pull candidate parcels for a county from the statewide DOR cadastral
layer, filtered by agricultural use code, acreage range, and (best
effort) single ownership.

This is the "Run scan" step from the UI — it does NOT do the perimeter
encirclement analysis (that needs the FLUM layer and real geometry
operations, handled in encirclement.py). This module's job is narrowing
10.8 million statewide parcels down to a county-sized candidate set fast,
using attribute filters only.

    Query the statewide cadastral layer for parcels in one county that
    plausibly meet the acreage and agricultural-use criteria.

    max_candidates caps how many parcels this pulls WITH geometry. This
    matters because acreage isn't a stored, queryable field on this
    layer (it's derived from LND_SQFOOT after the fact), so the acreage
    filter can't be pushed down into the ArcGIS WHERE clause — every
    matching DOR_UC parcel in the county has to be fetched and checked
    client-side. For a large county this can be thousands of parcels;
    pulling full polygon geometry for all of them in one request is what
    caused the initial timeout against the live server. Capping at 200
    keeps a first real-world scan fast; raise this once scan performance
    has been profiled against real response times, and consider fetching
    attributes-only first (return_geometry=False) to do the acreage
    filter, then a second geometry-only fetch for just the survivors —
    a cheaper two-pass approach not yet implemented here.

    Notes on what this filter CAN and CANNOT determine on its own:
      - Acreage cap and DOR use code: directly filterable (acreage is
        filtered client-side after fetch, as described above).
      - "Single owner/entity": the cadastral layer has no concept of
        multi-parcel ownership clusters. This function can only filter
        on owner name patterns it can not group adjacent parcels under
        common ownership across a multi-parcel enclave. Real single-
        ownership/control verification still requires a title search,
        exactly as flagged in the UI's checklist.
      - 5-year continuous agricultural use: not available at all in this
        layer. JV_CLASS_U (just value, classified use) and AV_CLASS_U
        being non-null/non-zero are a weak proxy — they indicate the
        parcel currently carries an agricultural classification for tax
        purposes, but say nothing about duration.
